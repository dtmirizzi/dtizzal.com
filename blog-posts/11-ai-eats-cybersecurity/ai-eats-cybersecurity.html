      <h1><strong>AI Will Eat Cybersecurity</strong></h1>

      <p>
        On February 20th, 2026, cybersecurity stocks cratered. CrowdStrike dropped nearly 8%. Cloudflare fell over 8%.
        The catalyst wasn't a breach, a recession scare, or an earnings miss. It was a research preview. Anthropic
        launched Claude Code Security, a tool that reasons about code vulnerabilities the way a human security
        researcher would, and Wall Street immediately repriced the entire sector.<sup><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        This wasn't a surprise to anyone paying attention. It was an inevitability.
      </p>

      <h2><strong>Anthropic is not building a security startup</strong></h2>

      <p>
        Here's what most people miss: Anthropic isn't trying to compete with CrowdStrike. They're not building a
        security startup. They're building AI that reasons, and then pointing it at security as one of the first
        verticals where that reasoning pays for itself immediately. The distinction matters enormously.
      </p>

      <p>
        Look at the job posting for their Cybersecurity Products team.<sup><a href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> It reads
        nothing like a traditional security vendor's hiring page. They want engineers with 7+ years of experience who
        can "work across the stack to prototype new ideas and build from the ground up." They want people who've done
        incident response, reverse engineering, penetration testing. They want people who can build agentic
        applications. And they want these people to sit at the intersection of research, product development, and
        market strategy, collaborating directly with researchers to develop security-focused AI capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's not a security company hiring engineers. That's an AI research lab building point vendor solutions from
        first principles, rethinking what security products should look like when your core primitive is reasoning
        rather than signatures.
      </p>

      <h2><strong>The legacy vendors are not ready</strong></h2>

      <p>
        Let me be blunt: basically all of the existing legacy cybersecurity vendors are not anywhere remotely ready for
        this.
      </p>

      <p>
        The incumbent model is well understood. You ship agents to endpoints. You collect telemetry. You write
        detection rules. You build dashboards. You sell seats. You upsell SIEM, SOAR, XDR, and whatever acronym the
        analyst firms are pushing this quarter. The moat is integration sprawl and procurement inertia. The product is
        a pane of glass on top of a regex engine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Claude Code Security doesn't scan code with pattern matching. It "maps component interactions and data flow"
        to find vulnerabilities like input filtering defects and authentication bypass weaknesses. It ranks findings by
        severity and generates natural language explanations with suggested fixes. It reasons about your code the way a
        human security researcher would.<sup><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        That's not an incremental improvement. That's a categorical shift in what "security tooling" means. And the
        legacy vendors can't replicate it because they don't have the foundational models. They'll bolt on API calls to
        OpenAI or Anthropic and call it "AI-powered," but that's renting the revolution, not owning it.
      </p>

      <h2><strong>Why AI labs have the structural advantage</strong></h2>

      <p>
        Security is fundamentally an adversarial reasoning problem. Attackers don't follow signatures. They find novel
        paths through complex systems. Defending against that has always required human judgment: reading code,
        understanding context, mapping trust boundaries, thinking like an attacker. That's exactly what large language
        models are getting good at.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anthropic's structural advantage is threefold:
      </p>

      <p>
        First, they own the model. They're not integrating someone else's reasoning engine; they're building it. When
        they discover a new capability relevant to security, the product team is sitting next to the research team
        that made it happen. The feedback loop from "this model can now reason about X" to "ship it as a security
        feature" is measured in weeks, not quarters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, they're prototyping from the future backwards. The Cybersecurity Products team isn't constrained by
        ten years of legacy architecture. They're not trying to make an endpoint agent smarter. They're asking: if you
        had a reasoning engine that could understand code, map data flows, and think adversarially, what would you
        build? The answer looks nothing like what exists today.
      </p>

      <p>
        Third, the economics are inverted. Traditional security vendors need large sales teams, long procurement
        cycles, and per-seat pricing to justify their existence. An AI-native security tool that ships as a feature of
        your existing development workflow, integrated into CI/CD, available inside the IDE, doesn't need any of that.
        It just works where you already are.
      </p>

      <h2><strong>This isn't just Anthropic</strong></h2>

      <p>
        OpenAI launched Aardvark roughly four months before Claude Code Security. It tests vulnerabilities in isolated
        sandboxes to assess exploitation difficulty.<sup><a href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup> The AI labs are converging on
        security as an obvious application of reasoning capabilities because it is one. The question isn't whether AI
        eats cybersecurity. It's how fast, and who gets displaced.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next move is obvious: integrate these tools directly into CI/CD pipelines to automatically prevent
        vulnerable code from ever being deployed. That's a capability established vendors already offer in primitive
        form with SAST and DAST scanners. But those tools flag everything and understand nothing. An AI-native version
        that actually reasons about exploitability, prioritizes real risk, and explains its findings in plain English
        doesn't just compete with legacy scanning. It replaces it entirely.
      </p>

      <h2><strong>What the stock drop actually means</strong></h2>

      <p>
        The market's reaction on February 20th wasn't about Claude Code Security being a finished product. It's a
        research preview. The market was pricing in the trajectory. If Anthropic can ship a tool in limited preview
        that reasons about code security better than the static analysis tools companies pay millions for, what
        happens when it's generally available? What happens when it's integrated into every Claude-powered development
        environment? What happens when it expands from code review to runtime detection, incident response, and threat
        hunting?
      </p>

      <p>
        The answer is that a significant chunk of what the cybersecurity industry sells today becomes a feature, not a
        product. And features don't command $30B market caps.
      </p>

      <h2><strong>The uncomfortable conclusion</strong></h2>

      <p>
        I work in security. I've spent my career building security products. And I think the honest assessment is this:
        the cybersecurity industry as we know it is about to be fundamentally restructured by AI, and the restructuring
        won't be led by the incumbents. It will be led by the AI labs who can reason about security from first
        principles, prototype at research speed, and ship into workflows where developers and operators already live.
      </p>

      <p>
        The legacy vendors will acquire, partner, and rebrand. Some will adapt. Most will slowly become irrelevant in
        the same way that antivirus companies became irrelevant when the threat landscape moved past signature
        matching. The difference is that this time the displacement won't take a decade. It'll take a product cycle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anthropic is hiring engineers to "prototype new ideas and build from the ground up" at the intersection of AI
        research and cybersecurity product development, paying $320K-$405K. That's not a job posting. That's a
        declaration of intent. And the market heard it loud and clear.
